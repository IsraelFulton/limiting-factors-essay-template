## Why this matters
A short narrative hook goes here. Define "grant-equivalent" and the scope of this essay.

## Data & Methods
- Data sources and licenses
- Grant-equivalent mapping
- Base year and deflators
- Reproduction steps are in the README. Full detail in `METHODS.md`.

## Findings
::: {.callout-tip}
**One idea per chart.** Captions must carry the claim.
:::

```{python}
#| label: fig-gap-over-time
#| fig-cap: "Pledges vs. disbursements over time: the gap and the lag."
# Demo placeholder. Replace with real data.
import pandas as pd, numpy as np, matplotlib.pyplot as plt
years = np.arange(2015, 2025)
pledges = np.linspace(10, 60, len(years))
disb = pledges * np.linspace(0.3, 0.8, len(years))
plt.plot(years, pledges, label="Pledges")
plt.plot(years, disb, label="Disbursements (grant-equivalent)")
plt.legend()
plt.xlabel("Year"); plt.ylabel("USD (bn)")
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```

## What it means
Implications for credibility, pipeline planning, and monitoring.
